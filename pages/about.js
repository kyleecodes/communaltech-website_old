            Technical community management is the intersection of community management and tech, while community management is the intersection of marketing, business development, and content/social media.
            <br /> <br />
            A great way to grasp community management is to view it from the perspective of
            marketing. While community management and marketing are two
            different areas, the two often intersect, and their differences
            highlight what makes community management unique. Community management
            focuses on user retention while traditional marketing focuses on
            user reach. In other words, marketing gets users in the door, while
            community management keeps them there. 
            <br /> <br />
            Technical community management is specialized community management for the tech industry. We are well-versed in technology, don't shy away from analytic tools, and use our empathy as a superpower. 
            We intersect with engineering to address the unique needs of developers, which are often not met by traditional marketing, business development, and content/social media alone. Similar to developer relations and advocacy, but with a greater focus on community.
